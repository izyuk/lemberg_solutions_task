In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Tips: 
- to prevent any mistakes - every `'name'` key should have a `unique` value because I'm handling opened accordion by name in state :)
- there no functionality to collapse all nested items if parent is collapsed
